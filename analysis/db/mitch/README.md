-What does this figure show?

This figure shows the changes in NO2 concentrations for Milan, Italy and Wuhan, China.

-Why did you choose to look at the values shown in the figure?

Largely because NO2 is a commonly used substance to measure air quality and it was
the most available data I had out of my dataset.

-Why should someone care about these results?

Air pollution, especially from gases like nitrogen dioxide, are major sources of respiratory illnesses
and deaths in numerous cities. Although rooted in unfortunate circumstances, having cleaner air in cities will 
help save lives. Levels of air quality can also be an indicator of economic activity and how different governmets
reacted to the pandemic.

-What are the limitations/caveats to your data analysis?

	-What decisions did you make in the data processing that could under/overestimate your results
	
	I did not go back very far in my start date for my visualizations. In order to get a fuller view of 
	air quality changes from COVID-19, I should have at least started a full year back to accomodate other 
	potential factors such as seasonal changes.

	-What external factors could affect your results?

	Recent NO2 changes may not have been solely affected by COVID-19 quarantines. There could be countless of other variables
	that play a role in air quality. For example, there may be areas that have a high concentration of essential businesses 
	that require fossil fuel consumption and emission.

	-Another way to think about this is this: if you were to present your findings to the public and people are going to take your
	word to make some actionable decision, what would you tell them could skew the results and affect the decision making?

	I only measured the concentrations of one substance. There are many other pollutants to measure such as SO2, CO, CO2, and particulate matter.
